👋 Hey, I'm Diego Estrada

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a Software Engineering student at Brigham Young University–Idaho, and I love building real projects that help me grow as a developer. When I’m not coding, I’m probably watching soccer, catching up on Formula 1, or working on school projects that push me to learn something new.

🚀 About Me

🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Kotlin, Android Studio, algorithms, and data structures.

💻 I’m also learning backend development (Node.js, Express, APIs, databases) and frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UI/UX).

🎯 My goal is to become a strong and well-rounded software developer by building practical projects and continuously improving my problem-solving skills.

💬 Ask me about my projects, C++ debugging, Android apps, backend logic, or anything tech-related!
